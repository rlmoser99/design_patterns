# Command Pattern Notes
Structural Design Pattern

**Terminology:**
- Component - the "real" object, the object that implements the basic component functionality. (simple_writer in the Concrete Component)
- Decorator Class - has reference to a Component.
- Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind many design patterns, including Decorator.
- “Wrapper” is the alternative nickname for the Decorator pattern that clearly expresses the main idea of the pattern. A wrapper is an object that can be linked with some target object. 

**Use Cases:**
- To add responsibility to individual objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
- For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
- When extension by sub-classing is impractical.
